# We will start to explore additional ways of working with lists like:

# Add and remove items from a list using a specific index.
# Create lists with continuous values.
# Get the length of a list.
# Select portions of a list (called slicing).
# Count the number of times that an element appears in a list.
# Sort a list of items.
