# Python equips us with many different ways to store data.
# A float is a different kind of number from an int, and we store different data in a list than we do in a dict.
# These are known as different types.
# We can check the type of a Python variable using the type() function.

a_string = "Cool String"
an_int = 12

print(type(a_string))
# prints "<class 'str'>"

print(type(an_int))
# prints "<class 'int'>"

# Above, we defined two variables, and checked the type of these two variables.
# A variable’s type determines what you can do with it and how you can use it.
# You can’t .get() something from an integer, just as you can’t add two dictionaries together using +.
# This is because those operations are defined at the type level.

# A class is a template for a data type.
# It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a programmer will interact with that data.


class CoolClass:
    pass

# In the above example we created a class and named it CoolClass.
# We used the pass keyword in Python to indicate that the body of the class was intentionally left blank so we don’t cause an IndentationError.


class Facade:
    pass

# A class doesn’t accomplish anything simply by being defined.
# A class must be instantiated.
# In other words, we must create an instance of the class, in order to breathe life into the schematic.
# Instantiating a class looks a lot like calling a function.


# We would be able to create an instance of our defined CoolClass as follows:
cool_instance = CoolClass()

# Above, we created an object by adding parentheses to the name of the class.
# We then assigned that new instance to the variable cool_instance for safe-keeping so we can access our instance of CoolClass at a later time.


class Facade:
    pass


facade_1 = Facade()

# A class instance is also called an object.
# The pattern of defining classes and creating objects to represent the responsibilities of a program is known as Object Oriented Programming or OOP.
# Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object, the type() function does the opposite of that.
# When called with an object, it returns the class that the object is an instance of.

print(type(cool_instance))
# prints "<class '__main__.CoolClass'>"
# We then print out the type() of cool_instance and it shows us that this object is of type __main__.CoolClass.
# In Python __main__ means “this current file that we’re running” and so one could read the output from type() to mean “the class CoolClass that was defined here, in the script you’re currently running.”


class Facade:
    pass


facade_1 = Facade()
facade_1_type = type(facade_1)
print(type(facade_1))

# When we want the same data to be available to every instance of a class we use a class variable.
# A class variable is a variable that’s the same for every instance of the class.
# You can define a class variable by including it in the indented part of your class definition, and you can access all of an object’s class variables with object.variable syntax.


class Musician:
    title = "Rockstar"


drummer = Musician()
print(drummer.title)
# prints "Rockstar"

# Above we defined the class Musician, then instantiated drummer to be an object of type Musician.
# We then printed out the drummer’s .title attribute, which is a class variable that we defined as the string “Rockstar”.
# If we defined another musician, like guitarist = Musician() they would have the same .title attribute.


class Grade:

# Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class.
# The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method.
# Convention recommends that we name this first argument self.
# Methods always have at least this one argument.
# We define methods similarly to functions, except that they are indented to be part of the class.


class Dog:
    dog_time_dilation = 7

    def time_explanation(self):
        print("Dogs experience {} years for every 1 human year.".format(
            self.dog_time_dilation))


pipi_pitbull = Dog()
pipi_pitbull.time_explanation()
# Prints "Dogs experience 7 years for every 1 human year."
# Above we created a Dog class with a time_explanation method that takes one argument, self, which refers to the object calling the function.
# We created a Dog named pipi_pitbull and called the .time_explanation() method on our new object for Pipi.
# Notice we didn’t pass any arguments when we called .time_explanation(), but were able to refer to self in the function body.
# When you call a method it automatically passes the object calling the method as the first argument.


class Rules:
    def washing_brushes(self):
        return "Point bristles towards the basin while washing your brushes."

# Methods can also take more arguments than just self:


class DistanceConverter:
    kms_in_a_mile = 1.609

    def how_many_kms(self, miles):
        return miles * self.kms_in_a_mile


converter = DistanceConverter()
kms_in_5_miles = converter.how_many_kms(5)
print(kms_in_5_miles)
# prints "8.045"

# Above we defined a DistanceConverter class, instantiated it, and used it to convert 5 miles into kilometers.
# Notice again that even though how_many_kms takes two arguments in its definition, we only pass miles, because self is implicitly passed (and refers to the object converter).


class Circle:
    pi = 3.14

# There are several methods that we can define in a Python class that have special behavior.
# These methods are sometimes called “magic,” because they behave differently from regular methods.
# Another popular term is dunder methods, so-named because they have two underscores (double-underscore abbreviated to “dunder”) on either side of them.
# The first dunder method we’re going to use is the __init__() method (note the two underscores before and after the word “init”).
# This method is used to initialize a newly created object.
# It is called every time the class is instantiated.
# Methods that are used to prepare an object being instantiated are called constructors.
# The word “constructor” is used to describe similar features in other object-oriented programming languages but programmers who refer to a constructor in Python are usually talking about the __init__() method.


class Shouter:
    def __init__(self):
        print("HELLO?!")


shout1 = Shouter()
# prints "HELLO?!"

shout2 = Shouter()
# prints "HELLO?!"

# Above we created a class called Shouter and every time we create an instance of Shouter the program prints out a shout.
# Pay careful attention to the instantiation syntax we use.
# Shouter() looks a lot like a function call, doesn’t it? If it’s a function, can we pass parameters to it? We absolutely can, and those parameters will be received by the __init__() method.


class Shouter:
    def __init__(self, phrase):
        # make sure phrase is a string
        if type(phrase) == str:

            # then shout it out
            print(phrase.upper())


shout1 = Shouter("shout")
# prints "SHOUT"

shout2 = Shouter("shout")
# prints "SHOUT"

shout3 = Shouter("let it all out")
# prints "LET IT ALL OUT"

# Above we’ve updated our Shouter class to take the additional parameter phrase.
# When we created each of our objects we passed an argument to the constructor.
# The constructor takes the argument phrase and, if it’s a string, prints out the all-caps version of phrase.

# We’ve learned so far that a class is a schematic for a data type and an object is an instance of a class, but why is there such a strong need to differentiate the two if each object can only have the methods and class variables the class has?
# This is because each instance of a class can hold different kinds of data.
# The data held by an object is referred to as an instance variable.
# Instance variables aren’t shared by all instances of a class — they are variables that are specific to the object they are attached to.


class FakeDict:
    pass


# We can instantiate two different objects from this class, fake_dict1 and fake_dict2, and assign instance variables to these objects using the same attribute notation that was used for accessing class variables.

fake_dict2.fake_key = "This too!"

# Let's join the two strings together!

# Instance variables and class variables are both accessed similarly in Python.
# This is no mistake, they are both considered attributes of an object.
# If we attempt to access an attribute that is neither a class variable nor an instance variable of the object Python will throw an AttributeError.

# What if we aren’t sure if an object has an attribute or not?
# hasattr() will return True if an object has a given attribute and False otherwise.
# If we want to get the actual value of the attribute, getattr() is a Python function that will return the value of a given object and attribute.
# In this function, we can also supply a third argument that will be the default if the object does not have the given attribute.

# The syntax and parameters for these functions look like this:

# hasattr(object, “attribute”) has two parameters:
# object : the object we are testing to see if it has a certain attribute
# attribute : name of attribute we want to see if it exists

# getattr(object, “attribute”, default) has three parameters (one of which is optional):
# object : the object whose attribute we want to evaluate
# attribute : name of attribute we want to evaluate
# default : the value that is returned if the attribute does not exist (note: this parameter is optional)

hasattr(attributeless, "fake_attribute")
# returns False

getattr(attributeless, "other_fake_attribute", 800)
# returns 800, the default value
