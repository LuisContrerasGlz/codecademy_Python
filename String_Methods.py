# Do you have a gigantic string that you need to parse for information?
# Do you need to sanitize a users input to work in a function?
# Do you need to be able to generate outputs with variable values?
# All of these things can be accomplished with string methods!

# Python comes with built-in string methods that gives you the power to perform complicated tasks on strings very quickly and efficiently.
# These string methods allow you to change the case of a string, split a string into many smaller strings,
# join many small strings together into a larger string, and allow you to neatly combine changing variables with string outputs.

# string_name.string_method(arguments) a string method is called at the end of a string and each one has its own method specific arguments.
