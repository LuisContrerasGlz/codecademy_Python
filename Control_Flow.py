# Learn how to build control flow into your python code by including if, else, and elif statements as well as try and except statements.
# Expect to learn all you need to know about boolean variables and logical operators.

# In order to build control flow into our program, we want to be able to check if something is true or not. A boolean expression is a statement that can either be True or False.

# Relational operators compare two items and return either True or False.
# For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparators.
# The two relational operators we‚Äôll cover first are:

# Equals: ==
# Not equals: !=
# These operators compare two items and return True or False if they are equal or not.

# Python refers to the mistakes within the program as errors and will point to the location where an error occurred with a ^ character.
# When programs throw errors that we didn‚Äôt expect to encounter, we call those errors bugs.
# Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces bugs debugging.

# In Python, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but here are some common ones:

# SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
# NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown.
# TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.

# Here‚Äôs an example of a SyntaxError error message:

# File "script.py", line 1
#  print(Hello world!)
#                  ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# Some common syntax errors are:

# Misspelling a Python keyword.
# Missing colon :.
# Missing closing parenthesis ), square bracket ], or curly brace }.
