# Learn how to build control flow into your python code by including if, else, and elif statements as well as try and except statements.
# Expect to learn all you need to know about boolean variables and logical operators.

# In order to build control flow into our program, we want to be able to check if something is true or not. A boolean expression is a statement that can either be True or False.

# "Dogs are mammals"
statement_one = "Yes"

# My dog is named Pavel.
statement_two = "Yes"

# Dogs make the best pets.
statement_three = "No"

# Cats are female dogs.
statement_four = "Yes"

# Relational operators compare two items and return either True or False.
# For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparators.
# The two relational operators weâ€™ll cover first are:

# Equals: ==
# Not equals: !=
# These operators compare two items and return True or False if they are equal or not.

statement_one = (5 * 2) - 1 == 8 + 1

statement_two = 13 - 6 != (3 * 2) + 1

statement_three = 3 * (2 - 1) == 4 - 1
